# NVidia-Optimus-Bug 

Look in the dist folder.

Put NVidia-Optimus-Bug.jar in, by example, C:\APP\utilities\NVidia-Optimus-Bug.jar (if you change the path you need to edit the .bat file)
Put Nvidia-optimus-bug.bat in your startup folder (Windows menu -> All programs -> Startup)

Restart or execute the .bat

Now, you have the icon of a black locker in your tray. When you click on it, the locker is red.
BLACK = ONLY LOAD SIGNED DLL
RED = LOAD UNSIGNED DLL

It's solve the "optimus bug driver". When you want that a software uses your NVidia card, put the locker on red otherwize on black. Don't forget to go under NVidia config panel to set the software which needs to use your NVidia card.
Sometimes, the software will crash, it's like that, I can't do anything. You need to use your intel card.
